Free Code Camp Projects
  I'm trying to work on Python project recommended by Free Code Camp. Below are the links to the project instructions so that you can understand what the project is about before I my areas of confusion.

   This is the URL for the Python file FCC Proj3 file:
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app

  This is the URL to the instruction for the FCC Proj5 file:
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/probability-calculator

  After you've seen the project instructions through the link, please copy the content of the file and run them on Python so that you can see what the code does for yourself.

  Now that you have run both Python files on your computer, here is my issue.

  For the FCC Proj5 file on the probability calculator, I need to use the contents of the 'self.contents' in the 'Hat' class I created on Python for the 'experiment' function but the experiment function is outside the class and the insturctions orderd us to do so. Within the 'experiment' function, at the line where I created the variable 'hat_copy', I used 'hat.contents' to be able to extract the 'self.contents' from the object in the class but it's not working. I have gotten every other aspect of the project except this. What should I do to rectify this issue?

  For the FCC Proj3 file on the budget app, I created a class 'Category'. I understand every other aspect of the project and I got them right but in the 'def __str__' method I am havig an issue.
  I'm tring to print out all the items in my list but it only prints the first item. What do I do?

  Thank you for your time.
